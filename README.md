# PancakeSombrero
PancakeSombrero is a simple JavaScript framework for random utilities. Essentially, this framework is intended to be a collection of functions that you wish JavaScript had to begin with! I am using this framework as a brain dump of code that I feel could be useful for fellow JavaScript developers.

Name Origin:<br>
On another note, you may be asking, where did the "PancakeSombrero" name come from? Well, it may sound odd, but I love Sombreros and
Pancakes; as a result, I thought why not combine the two into a name :)

Use:<br>
All you have to do is download the framework and import it into your html page; in other words, in your head tag, add "<script src='PancakeSombrero.js'></script>"

# PancakeSombrero
PancakeSombrero is a simple JavaScript framework for random utilities. Essentially, this framework is intended to be a collection of functions that you wish JavaScript had to begin with! I am using this framework as a brain dump of code that I feel could be useful for fellow JavaScript developers and you should too!

Name Origin:<br>
On another note, you may be asking, where did the "PancakeSombrero" name come from? Well, it may sound odd, but I love Sombreros and
Pancakes; as a result, I thought why not combine the two into a name :)

Use:<br>
(1) All you have to do is download the framework and import it into your html page; in other words, in your head tag, add "<script src='PancakeSombrero.js'></script>"
(2) In your code, use the PancakeSombrero object to call the functions! For example, if you wish to split an array into two separate arrays using a target, all you have to do is call PancakeSombrero.splitList([1,2,3,4,5], 3).

# PancakeSombrero
A simple JavaScript framework for random utilities. Essentially, this framework should be a collection of functions that include those you
wish JavaScript had to begin with! I am using this framework as a brain dump of code that I feel could be useful for fellow JavaScript
developers.

Name Origin:
On another note, you may be asking, where did the "PancakeSombrero" name come from? Well, it may sound odd, but I love Sombreros and
Pancakes; as a result, I thought why not combine the two into a name :)

Use:
All you have to do is download the framework and import it into your html page. Essentially, do the following:

<html>
<head>
  <script src='/path/to/PancakeSombrero.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
